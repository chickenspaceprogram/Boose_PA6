# Battleship

To build this project, you must have CMake installed.

### Configuring CMake

Then, `cd` into the `build` directory and enter `cmake .` to configure CMake. Once you've configured CMake, you can then build the project.

### Building on *nix

To build the project on a Unix-based OS, enter `cmake --build .` when in the `build` directory, or `cmake --build build` when in the parent `Boose_PA6` directory. The executable will then compile and will be located in the `build` directory.

### Building on Windows

To build the project on Windows, you must use Microsoft Visual Studio. Open the `Boose_PA6.sln` file located in the `build` directory. Once Visual Studio has opened, right-click `Boose_PA6` in the Solution Explorer and select `Set as Startup Project`. Then, build the project.
